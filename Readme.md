# Quantum Algorithms Development with Qiskit


## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of various quantum algorithms using the Qiskit framework. Each algorithm is designed to showcase the power and potential of quantum computing in solving complex problems more efficiently than classical algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) :white_check_mark: DONE
The Quantum Fourier Transform is a quantum analog of the discrete Fourier transform. It is a crucial component in many quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm for factoring integers. QFT transforms a quantum state into its frequency domain representation, allowing for efficient computation of periodicity.

### 2. Grover's Search Algorithm
Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems. It leverages quantum superposition and interference to locate a specific item within an unsorted database with significantly fewer queries compared to classical algorithms.

### 3. Shor's Algorithm
Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization. It exponentially accelerates the factoring process, breaking widely used cryptographic systems like RSA. Shor's algorithm uses quantum Fourier transform and modular exponentiation to achieve this speedup.

### 4. Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) :white_check_mark: DONE
Quantum Phase Estimation is a fundamental algorithm used to determine the eigenvalues of a unitary operator. It forms the basis for many other quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm and algorithms for solving linear systems of equations.

##### 5. *** Once the above algorithms are developed, I will add more ***
